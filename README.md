## Description

I'm not a programmer, and most of this widgets weren't made from scratch by me, but this repository might be useful to someone as a reference.

I use Arch linux, the widgets are made with eww, the app launcher, clippboard and wallaper changer with rofi. 

The colors are generated by a python script, gtk theming is applied with gradience. 

For the weather widget you have to edit the weather.py file with you api, city and country.
